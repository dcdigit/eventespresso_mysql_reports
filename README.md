# eventespresso_mysql_reports
Event Espresso MySQL code for reports

Use these with a Wordpress SQL report plugin like https://wordpress.org/plugins/exports-and-reports/

NOTE: the MySQL snippets here may need to be modified to use your WP prefix. The default is wp_ but many installs will have a different prefix.
